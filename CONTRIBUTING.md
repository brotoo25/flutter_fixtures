# Contributing to Flutter Fixtures

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Flutter Fixtures! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üéØ Project Overview

Flutter Fixtures is a universal data mocking library for Flutter that works with any data source - HTTP APIs, databases, file systems, GraphQL endpoints, and more. The library is designed to be modular, extensible, and easy to use.

## üì¶ Project Structure

The project is organized as a Flutter workspace with multiple packages:

- **`packages/flutter_fixtures_core`**: Core interfaces and domain models
- **`packages/flutter_fixtures_dio`**: Dio HTTP client implementation  
- **`packages/flutter_fixtures_ui`**: UI components for fixture selection
- **`packages/flutter_fixtures`**: Meta-package combining all components
- **`example/`**: Example application demonstrating usage

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Dart SDK (comes with Flutter)
- Git

### Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brotoo25/flutter_fixtures.git
   cd flutter_fixtures
   ```

2. **Get dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run tests to ensure everything works**
   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```

4. **Run the example app**
   ```bash
   cd example
   flutter run
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing code style and patterns
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   flutter test
   
   # Run analysis
   flutter analyze
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

### Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add GraphQL data provider support
fix: handle null values in fixture selection
docs: update README with new examples
test: add unit tests for FixtureSelector mixin
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- **Unit tests**: Test individual classes and methods
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **Example tests**: Ensure examples work correctly

### Test Structure

```dart
void main() {
  group('ClassName', () {
    late ClassName instance;
    
    setUp(() {
      instance = ClassName();
    });
    
    group('methodName', () {
      test('should do something when condition', () {
        // Arrange
        // Act  
        // Assert
      });
    });
  });
}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
flutter test

# Specific package
flutter test packages/flutter_fixtures_core

# With coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

## üìù Documentation Guidelines

### Code Documentation

- Use clear, descriptive comments
- Document public APIs with dartdoc comments
- Include examples in documentation when helpful

```dart
/// Creates a fixture interceptor for Dio HTTP client.
///
/// The [dataQuery] is used to load and parse fixture files.
/// The [dataSelector] determines how fixtures are selected.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final interceptor = FixturesInterceptor(
///   dataQuery: DioDataQuery(),
///   dataSelector: DataSelectorType.random(),
/// );
/// ```
class FixturesInterceptor {
  // Implementation
}
```

### README Updates

- Keep package-specific READMEs focused on their functionality
- Update the main README for significant changes
- Include practical examples
- Add troubleshooting information when relevant

## üé® Code Style

### Dart Style Guide

- Follow the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use `dart format` to format code
- Run `flutter analyze` to check for issues

### Package Organization

- Keep packages focused on single responsibilities
- Use clear, descriptive names for classes and methods
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
